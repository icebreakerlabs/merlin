## Overview

Simply fork this repository, deploy your contract using [Thirdweb][Thirdweb-url], and deploy the repo with the correct environment variables in [Vercel][Vercel-url]. 

Let us know what features you'd like to see for [future upgrades](#contributing).

## Installation

1. Fork (i.e., copy) the repo on github to your own account.

2. Deploy your personal [Signature Drop NFT contract on Thirdweb][1]. Make sure you've updated the claim conditions to allow people to mint and uploaded your NFTs. 

[1]: <https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/signature-drop> "Thirdweb Signature Drop Contract"


3. [**Optional step**] Set up your [Typeform][Typeform-url] for contact info. This'll allow minters to enter their contact info after minting your NFT. Make sure you've configured hidden fields of `@address` and `@owner` from the "Advanced" settings in the share tab. Get your typeform ID by looking at the parameter `xxxxx` in the url on that admin page at `https://admin.typeform.com/form/xxxxx/share`.

4. Deploy the repo using [Vercel][Vercel-url].
  - Set the drop address and active chains in the environment variables in vercel:
  
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_DROP_ADDRESS="YOUR DROP ADDRESS"`
    
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTIVE_CHAIN="YOUR SELECTED CHAIN"`
  - See [Thirdweb][Thirdweb-url] for the list of potential chains. Note that these are case sensitive.
  - Consider creating a QR code from a free generator like [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com/qr-code-generator/builder) and printing it for easier distribution at your event.
